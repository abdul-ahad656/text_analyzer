1-understanding of outpatient dispensing process
the process of dispensing to out-patients involves following steps:
prescription review 
prescription punching 
prescription filling 
prescription dispensing 
prescription review: upon receiving a prescription from the patient or caregiver, the pharmacist thoroughly reviews it for accuracy and completeness to ensure it is error-free. if any discrepancies or errors are identified, the pharmacist discusses them with the prescribing doctor, performs the necessary intervention, and documents the action in the intervention register for record-keeping.
prescription punching: once reviewed, pharmacist generates label for each medicine of that prescription. the label contain following information:
patient’s name and medical record number (mrn).
brand and generic name of medicine.
dose, frequency, route and duration of use. 
instructions about use if any. 
in case of high alert, it is notified on label.
initials of technician who filled prescription and pharmacist who do final verification.
prescription filling: on receiving labels, technicians carefully fill those prescriptions and affix labels on respective medicines and sign the label.
prescription dispensing: pharmacist verifies those medicines against prescription and invoice, sign that label and before handing over the medicine, pharmacist counsels the patient regarding:
purpose of medicine and how to take it.
storage conditions. 
possible side effects if any and what to do in this case.
special instructions in case of polypharmacy.
errors in dispensing process:
error can may occur at any step of dispensing process. however, if an error is identified and corrected before dispensing to the patient, it is referred to as near-miss. such incidents must be properly documented, reported, and signed by the responsible personnel.
dispensing of narcotics and controlled substances to outpatients:
narcotic and controlled substance prescription must be issued by authorized person and must have signature or stamp of respective prescriber.
prescription must have patient’s full details (name, gender, age, address, mrn, medication history, medical condition, any drug allergies, presenting complaints etc).
the drug name, strength, dose, duration, directions for use and refill instructions must be properly and clearly stated.
narcotic prescriptions are valid for a specific period after which a new prescription is required for dispensing.
quantity that is being dispensed to patient by pharmacy must be mentioned on the prescription and signed by pharmacist for record.
narcotics and controlled substances registers should be properly updated.
2- pregnancy categories 
in 1979, fda introduced five-letter based categories: a, b, c, d and x to provide guidance on the safety of medications during pregnancy, with respect to their potential risks to fetus. these categories help clinicians weigh the benefits versus risks when prescribing medications to pregnant women.
3-high alert medications (hams)
 high alert medications are drugs that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm when they are used in error. hams often have narrow therapeutic index, potential for severe adverse effects and high risk of medication error. safe use of ham is influenced by the following factors:  education and involvement of patients and the public, knowledge, skills and safe practices by healthcare professionals, safe handling and use of medicines, system design and infrastructure to support safe medication use.
the institute for safe medication practices (ismp) compiles and regularly updates a list of high-alert medications. this list is based on reports submitted to the ismp national medication errors reporting program (ismp merp), published cases of harmful errors, research identifying drugs most commonly involved in serious incidents, and input from healthcare professionals and safety experts. few high alert medications are listed below:
 
protocols for high-alert medications:
prescriptions must be complete and non-ambiguous and discourage use of abbreviations or short forms, naked decimals, trailing zero.
orders must be reviewed by pharmacist first and then administered.
verbal orders must be avoided unless in an emergency or life-threatening condition.
when stored in the healthcare facility, bins should be labelled with generic name of drug in bold, brand and strength and labelled as:



double checking the medication before dispensing.
any adverse drug reaction (adr) noticed shall be communicated to the physician immediately.
any medication error or near miss must be reported properly. once errors are reported actions must be taken to prevent similar errors in the future.
in case of drugs that need to be diluted first, auxiliary colored sticker should be affixed on the neck of vial/ampule.


a reversal agent should also be available immediately when needed for example neostigmine for reversal of effect of neuromuscular blockers, naloxone for opioids. 
4-look-alike sound-alike medication (lasa)
look-alike sound-alike (lasa) medications involve medications that are similar in physical appearance or packaging and names of medications that have similar spelling, phonetics or read-alike effect. few examples are listed below:


protocol for lasa:
a healthcare facility can generate its own lasa drug list by reviewing the error-prone drugs due to similarity in name, packaging and phonetics. lasa pairs must be identified.
prescription must be complete and non-ambiguous.
double- checking before preparation and dispensing.
tall-man lettering: use of uppercase letters within the medication name to highlight differences between look-alike medication names. for example:

when stored on facility, bins should be labelled with brand, generic name and strength in bold to avoid mix-ups.
store lasa medications in distinct racks to reduce the risk of mix-ups
auxiliary labels should be affixed, stating 


any medication error or near miss must be reported properly.

general overview of work flow 
1-in patient dispensing process:
prescription receipt:
the pharmacist receives the prescription either physically or electronically 
prescription review:
the pharmacist reviews the prescription thoroughly for completeness, accuracy, appropriateness and make sure that it is error free.
label generation:
a dispensing label is generated with all relevant information: 
patient’s name , medical record number (mrn)
drug name, strength, dosage form, duration for use.
storage instructions.
signature of filling technician and dispensing pharmacist
special warning, high alert medicine if any 
prescription filling:
the correct medication is selected, counted and packed and labels are affixed to the respective medicine by technician.
final verification and dispensing:
pharmacists verify all medicines against prescription and invoice and hand over to the patient/ attendant.
2- unit dose dispensing (udd):
udd is medication dispensing process in which each dose of medication is pre-packed or dispensed in individual units. medications are supplied on daily basis (24 hours supply is dispensed). 
process of udd:
comprehensive review of prescription/ medication list received electronically is conducted by pharmacist to ensure accuracy and to prevent duplication or interaction.
unit dose preparation by technicians:  individual doses are packed and labelled with patient name, mrn, medication name, strength, dosage, instructions, ward location etc. 
final verification is done by pharmacist. 
unit doses are dispensed directly to patient care area.
3- medicine expiry handling: 
all medicines with 7 month remaining shelf life are segregated and placed on separate designated “near expiry rack”, arranged month wise (those expiring in 6 months, 5 months etc.). these medicines are prioritized for use under first expiry first out (fefo) system. a segregated product list is provided to warehouse and 6 months before expiry warehouse sends an intimation to respective company. when medicine reaches two months before expiry date, it is withdrawn from rack and returned to main store.
narcotics and controlled substances dispensing to in patients: 
narcotics are a type of controlled substance specifically used to relieve pain and often have high potential for addiction, while controlled substances include a broader range of drugs regulated by law due to their potential for abuse or harm
the dispensing of narcotic and controlled substances to inpatients must follow strict protocols to ensure compliance and safety. 
all such medications must be stored securely in a double-locked cabinet. 
dispensing should only occur upon receipt of a valid prescription. 
the substance must be handed over to the administering nurse in the presence of a witness, along with the official form provided by the ministry of health. this form must be accurately completed, detailing the dose administered, information about prescriber, administrator, patient and the remaining quantity. 
any unused portion of the medication must be discarded in accordance with institutional policy, and the empty vial, along with the completed form, must be returned to the pharmacy or designated authority for verification and record-keeping.















2- overview of available medicines and surgical supplies
drug profiles
1-paracetamol
class: antipyretic, analgesic
a- pharmacology:
mechanism of action:
paracetamol lowers fever by acting on the hypothalamus to regulate body temperature. it may also work outside the central nervous system to reduce the sensation of pain. additionally, it’s thought to block the production of prostaglandins in the brain, which helps with both pain relief and fever reduction.
 pharmacokinetics:
paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine. onset of pain relief occur within 5-10 minutes after administration with peak effect in 1 hour and duration of analgesic effect is 4-6 hours and antipyretic effect occur within 30 minutes with duration of at least 6 hours. volume of distribution is 1 l/kg and protein binding is 10 to 25%.
it is metabolized in liver following 2 major hepatic pathways: sulphuric acid and glucuronic acid pathways. only small fraction is metabolized by cyp 450 to reactive intermediate n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (napqi) that is detoxified by glutathione and then eliminated in the urine after conjugation with cysteine and mercapturic acid.
b- indications:
it is used for mild to moderate pain relief and reduction of fever.
c- doses:
tablet:  2 tab. of 500 mg every 4 hours (not to exceed 8 tab per day). daily dose of up to 4 grams may be used.
children 6-12 years: ½ to 1 tab. every 4 hour (not to exceed 4 tab per day) for not more than 3 days 
liquid: daily dose of up to 60mg/kg can be used in divided dose of 15mg/kg throughout 24 hours.
infusion: pain relief following surgery, urgent need to treat pain or hyperthermia. administered within 15 minutes. restricted for patients weighing more than 33kg and dosing based on patient weight

d-dose adjustments:
renal impairment: 
gfr≥50 ml/min: no dosage adjustment necessary
gfr 10-50 ml/min: administer every 6hr
gfr<10ml/min: administer every 8hr
hepatic impairment: 
use extreme caution; avoid use as much as possible; limit therapy to short-term use at doses not to exceed 2 g/day.
e-contraindications:
hypersensitivity to acetaminophen
severe hepatocellular insufficiency
f-warnings/precautions:
used with caution in case of chronic alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, dehydration, hepatocellular and renal insufficiency.
do not use with other products containing acetaminophen to avoid overdose. doses higher than recommended entail risk of very serious liver damage.
g-interactions:
absorption of paracetamol increases by medicine increasing gastric emptying: metoclopramide and decreases by drug decreasing gastric emptying like narcotics 
probenecid reduces 2 folds clearance of acetaminophen (so reduce the dose)
concomitant intake with oral anticoagulants lead to slight variation in inr values.
salicylamide prolong elimination t ½ of paracetamol.
h-undesirable effects:
adverse effects are rare. hypersensitivity reactions ranging from simple skin rash, urticaria to anaphylactic shock have been reported.
i-use in special population:
pregnancy:
use of normal doses during pregnancy not associated with increased risk of miscarriage or still birth; however, increase in fetal death or spontaneous abortion may be seen with maternal overdose if treatment delayed.
lactation:
after oral administration, small quantity excreted in milk no effects on nursing infants have been reported.
j- overdose:
overdosing can be fatal (10-15g can cause hepatotoxicity while 25g can cause death). symptoms appear within first 24 hours.
k-antidote:
n-acetyl cysteine is used to reverse the effects by restoring the glutathione stores.
the dosage regimen for oral nac starts with a loading dose of 140 mg/kg, followed by 17 doses, each at 70 mg/kg, given every 4 hours. the total duration of the treatment course is 72 hours.
the dosage regimen for iv nac is:
loading dose: 150 mg/kg iv; mix in 200 ml of 5% dextrose in water (d5w) and infuse   0over 1 h
dose 2: 50 mg/kg iv in 500 ml d5w over 4 h
dose 3: 100 mg/kg iv in 1000 ml d5w over 16 h









2-ibuprofen
class: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaids)
a-pharmacology:
mechanism of action:
ibuprofen elicits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity by inhibiting synthesis of prostaglandins in body tissues by inhibiting at least 2 cyclooxygenase isoenzymes, cyclooxygenase-1 (cox-1) and -2 (cox-2).
pharmacokinetic:
after oral administration, peak serum concentration is reached after 1–2 hours, and up to 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. the majority of ibuprofen is metabolized (hepatic metabolism) and eliminated within 24 hours in the urine; however, 1% of the unchanged drug is removed through biliary excretion.
ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. the s-enantiomer is pharmacologically active. the r-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the s-enantiomer in vivo. 
b-indications:
indicated for management of mild-to-moderate pain, or for moderate-to-severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.
reduction of fever.
c-dosage forms:
tablets: 200mg
liquid: 200mg/5ml
iv injection: 800mg/8ml
iv infusion: 400mg/ 100ml 
d-posology and method of administration:
tablet: maximum daily dose should not exceed 2400mg in divided doses. dose can be raised to 3200mg if necessary.
liquid: calculated on basis of 20-30mg/kg body weight. for 6-7 years: half teaspoon (2.5ml) or for 8-12 years: one teaspoon (5ml) 3-4 times daily.
iv: treatment should not exceed 3 days and infusion time must be least 30 minutes.
before administration, iv injection must be diluted with appropriate dilutions (0.9% sodium chloride, 5% dextrose or lactated ringer) and dilute to final concentration of 4mg/ml or less (8ml in 200ml diluent)
adults (for analgesia): 400-800mg every 6 hour, (for fever): 400mg iv followed by 400mg every 4-6 hours or 100mg to 200mg every 4 hours. maximum daily dose is 3200mg.

severe hepatic or renal insufficiency 
active or history of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events.
f-undesirable effects:
nausea, flatulence, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, dizziness, anemia, edema, hemorrhage, urinary retention, dyspepsia, abdominal discomfort, cough, nasal congestion.
g-special warnings and precautions for use:
undesirable effects may be minimized by using lowest effective dose for shortest period of time and concomitant use with other nsaids should be avoided.
nsaids cause an increased risk of git events: bleeding, ulcers, perforations.
nsaids can cause increase risk of cv events: myocardial infarction, stroke.
severe skin reactions (exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis ten etc.) can occur.
inhibit platelet aggregation.
respiratory disorders like bronchospasm, urticaria or angioedema have been reported with nsaids.
nsaids can lead to onset of new or worsening of pre-exiting hypertension.
hepatotoxicity (elevations of ast and alt level) have been reported
fluid retention and edema have been observed in patients.
nsaids may cause severe, potentially life-threatening drug reaction e.g. dress syndrome, characterized by fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes, and facial swelling. 
long-term administration of nsaids has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury, hyperkalemia have been reported.
anemia, due to occult or gross gi blood loss.
masking of inflammation and fever may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
blurred or diminished vision have been reported with oral ibuprofen. 
aseptic meningitis with fever and coma has been observed with oral therapy.
h-drug interactions:
anticoagulants: concomitant use with anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding.
alcohol: concomitant use can increase of stomach bleeding.
other nsaids: concomitant use is associated with increased risk of gi and cvs adverse events.
antihypertensive: nsaids may diminish antihypertensive effect of ace inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or beta blockers.
digoxin: nsaids increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.
diuretics: nsaids reduce the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics or thiazide diuretics.
lithium: nsaids increase the serum concentration and reduce renal clearance of lithium.
methotrexate: nsaids increase the methotrexate toxicity.
cyclosporine: concomitant use can increase nephrotoxicity of cyclosporine.
i-special considerations:
fertility
nsaids may prevent rupture of ovarian follicle and cause reversible infertility in some women. consider the withdrawal in women having difficulty conceiving or undergoing investigation of infertility.
pregnancy: category c during 1 and 2 trimester, category d during 3 trimester 
nsaids cause premature closure of foetal ductus arteriosus. avoid use at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy. use of nsaids at 20 week gestation is associated with cases of foetal renal dysfunction.
lactation: no lactation studies have been conducted with ibuprofen. there are no reports of adverse effect on breastfed child and no effects on milk production.
hepatic/renal impairment: patients with mild to moderate hepatic/renal insufficiency should receive reduced dose and for shortest duration and should be carefully monitored.
3- paracetamol + ibuprofen
a-pharmaceutical form: solution for infusion 
each 100ml contains paracetamol 1000mg and ibuprofen 300mg.
b-indications:
in adults for short-term symptomatic treatment of acute moderate pain and the reduction of fever, where an intravenous route is considered necessary or when other routes are not possible.
c-posology and method of administration:
for intravenous administration and short-term use only for a maximum 2 days. administer as 15 minute infusion every 6 hours, as necessary.
pediatric population: contraindicated in patients under age of 18 years.
adults:
d-special population:
elderly
lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration only if necessary. treatment should be reviewed at regular intervals and discontinue if no benefit seen.
renal impairment
ibuprofen dosage need to be reduced in renal insufficiency. initial dose should be reduced in mild to moderate impairment and kept as low as possible and used for shortest duration.
hepatic impairment
high doses of paracetamol is associated with hepatotoxicity and even hepatic failure and death. use extreme caution; avoid use as much as possible; limit therapy to short-term use at doses not to exceed 2 g/day.

4- naproxen+ esomeprazole 
class: nsaid and ppi
a-pharmacology:
mechanism of action:
naproxen: nsaid that inhibits inflammatory reactions and pain by decreasing activity of cyclo-oxygenase, which is responsible for prostaglandin synthesis; has antipyretic and analgesic effects
esomeprazole: a proton pump inhibitor; inhibits gastric acid secretion by inhibiting h+/k+-atpase enzyme system at secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. it is s-isomer of omeprazole.
how it works: it consists of esomeprazole magnesium immediate-release layer and enteric coated naproxen core. after oral administration, esomeprazole is released first in stomach and dissolution of naproxen take place in small intestine.
b- indication:
this combination is used for relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and to decrease the risk of gastric ulcer in patients associated with nsaids.
c-dosage forms:
modified release tablets: 375mg/20mg, 500mg/20mg 
d-dosage and administration:
1 tablet po twice daily, taken at least 30 minutes before meal
swallow whole tablet with liquid, do not chew, split, crush or dissolve the tablet.
use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.
if dose of esomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40mg is required, then consider different treatment options.
e- contraindications:
known hypersensitivity 
history of asthma, any allergic- type reaction after taking aspirin or other nsaids.
use during preop setting of coronary artery bypass graft (cabg) surgery.
pregnancy 3 trimester 
severe hepatic or renal insufficiency 
active or history of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events.

f-adverse effects:
most common adverse effects are erosive gastritis, dyspepsia, gastritis, gastric ulcer, upper abdominal pain, nausea.
g-special warnings and precautions for use:
precautions:
concomitant use with other nsaids should be avoided.
severe skin reactions (exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis ten etc.) can occur with use of nsaids
nsaids inhibit platelet aggregation.
respiratory disorders like bronchospasm, urticaria or angioedema have been reported with nsaids.
nsaids can lead to onset of new or worsening of pre-exiting hypertension.
hepatotoxicity (elevations of ast and alt level) have been reported
fluid retention and edema have been observed in patients.
hyperkalemia.
long-term administration of nsaids has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury
anemia, due to occult or gross gi blood loss.
nsaids may cause severe, potentially life-threatening drug reaction e.g. dress syndrome, characterized by fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes, and facial swelling. 
masking of inflammation and fever may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
ppis possibly associated with increased incidence of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad).
daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin b12) caused by hypo-or achlorhydria.
h- drug interactions:
concomitant use of nsaids may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin
 receptor antagonists, diuretics, and beta blockers, ace inhibitors.
when cyclosporin is co-administered there is increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
concomitant administration of esomeprazole and tacrolimus may increase the serum level of tacrolimus.
concomitant use of nsaids with lithium increases lithium plasma levels.
naproxen + esomeprazole may increase serum levels of methotrexate.
concomitant use of naproxen + esomeprazole with warfarin may result in increased risk of bleeding prothrombin time.
esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion and may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric ph is important (e.g. ketoconazole, iron salts)
digoxin, and naproxen + esomeprazole cause an increases in digoxin toxicity.
esomeprazole decreases exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel when co-administered with it.
i-special considerations:
pregnancy:
esomeprazole: can be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed
naproxen: category c (1st and 2nd trimester), category d (3rd trimester)
lactation: not recommended 










5- paracetamol+ orphenadrine citrate
class: muscle relaxant, analgesic  
a- pharmacology:
mechanism of action:
orphenadrine: it is skeletal muscle relaxant and may work through central atropine-like effect; anticholinergic activity in brain stem; has euphorigenic and analgesic properties.
paracetamol: it is analgesic and antipyretic and may work on hypothalamus to produce antipyresis, work peripherally to block pain impulse generation; may also inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in cns
pharmacokinetics: no data available
b-indications:
tension headache, occipital headaches associated with spasm of skeletal muscles of the head and neck.
acute and traumatic conditions of the limbs and trunk: sprains, strains
c-dosage form:

hypersensitivity to paracetamol or orphenadrine citrate
f-special warnings and precautions for use:
concomitant treatment with other medicines that contain orphenadrine or paracetamol is not recommended
orphenadrine citrate should be used with caution in patients with tachycardia, cardiac decompensation, coronary insufficiency or cardiac arrhythmias
paracetamol should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment 
orphenadrine may cause dizziness so it may impair the ability to engage in hazardous activities.
use in the elderly: the elderly should be advised to take a reduced dosage as they may be more susceptible to anticholinergic side effects at regular doses
pediatric use: not recommended for children under 12 years of age
g-drug interactions: 
concomitant use of orphenadrine with other anti-muscarinic drugs, alcohol and cns depressants should be avoided.
concomitant use of enzyme inducers such as alcohol or anticonvulsants with paracetamol increases paracetamol toxicity.
anticoagulant dose should be reduced if co-administered with paracetamol 
paracetamol may increase chloramphenicol concentrations.
paracetamol absorption is affected by medicines that affect gastric emptying such as metoclopramide increases absorption or antidepressants decreases absorption.
h-adverse effects: 
orphenadrine citrate: dryness of the mouth, tachycardia, palpitation, urinary hesitancy or retention, blurred vision, dilation of the pupils, increased ocular tension, weakness, nausea, headache, dizziness, constipation and drowsiness. these effects can usually be eliminated by reducing the dose.
paracetamol: nausea, dyspepsia, allergic or hematological reactions.
i-overdose:
no specific information is available on overdose.
in case of overdose, absorption can be reduced by administration of activated charcoal, sorbitol mixture or gastric lavage.
if it is indicated that 15g or more paracetamol has been ingested, then administer acetyl cysteine.
j-special considerations:
fertility: no data available 
pregnancy: category b2- not recommended for use during pregnancy 
lactation: should not be taken during lactation as both are excreted into breast milk.

6- bisphosphonates:
a-mechanism of action:
nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates work by inhibiting farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, which is important in promoting attachment of the osteoclast to the bone. as a result, the osteoclast detaches from the bone surface, thus inhibiting bone resorption and increasing bone density and reducing the risk of fracture. 
b-indications: 
bisphosphonates used for treatment prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, hypercalcemia of malignancy, paget disease of the bone, and malignancies with metastasis to the bone.
c-limitation of use: patients at low- risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3-5 years if use.
d-contraindications: 
history of hypersensitivity to the bisphosphonate
hypocalcemia ( correct hypoglycemia before use )
severe renal impairment with a  creatinine clearance (crcl<35ml/min)
avoid oral bisphosphonates in patients with esophageal disorders such as  esophageal stricture, esophageal varices, barrett's esophagus, inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.( consider intravenous preparations)
e-warnings and precautions:
coadministration with calcium, antacids, or oral medications containing multivalent cations will interfere with absorption
take with plain water only not with coffee, juice or any beverages.
ensure adequate intake of calcium, vitamin d (patients should receive supplemental calcium 1000 to 1200 mg/day and vitamin d 800 to 1000 international units/day if dietary intake is inadequate) 
severe esophageal risk greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the full glass of water and if symptoms of esophageal irritations develops, stop using it .
f-adverse effects:
gastrointestinal risks
 oral bisphosphonates can cause upper gi issues like reflux, esophagitis, and ulcers. risks increase with nsaid use and certain conditions. high-risk patients, such as those with esophageal disorders, should avoid oral bisphosphonates.
hypocalcemia
bisphosphonates can cause hypocalcemia, especially with iv use or underlying deficiencies like vitamin d deficiency, poor calcium intake, and hypoparathyroidism
 musculoskeletal pain
bisphosphonates can cause bone, joint, and muscle pain in some patients. symptoms can start anytime during treatment and may persist even after stopping the medication.
 infusion reaction
iv bisphosphonates can cause a reaction with flu-like symptoms, fever, muscle and joint pain, and headaches within 1-3 days. symptoms typically resolve with acetaminophen or nsaids. the reaction is most common after the first dose (up to 30%) and decreases with subsequent doses. it’s usually mild and doesn’t require stopping treatment.

atypical femoral fractures
long-term bisphosphonate use increases the risk of atypical femoral fractures. if an atypical fracture occurs, discontinuing bisphosphonates can reduce the risk of another fracture. a drug holiday may be considered after prolonged use.
osteonecrosis of the jaw
bisphosphonates can cause onj, a rare but serious condition. risk factors include dental procedures, cancer, certain therapies, poor oral hygiene, and underlying health conditions. the risk increases with longer bisphosphonate use.

9-glimepiride
class: oral hypoglycemic, sulphonyl urea 
a-pharmacology:
mechanism of action:
glimepiride works primarily by stimulating insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. it may also have extra pancreatic effects, such as reducing liver glucose production and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.
pharmacokinetics: 
glimepiride is completely absorbed from the gi tract with 100% oral bioavailability. it is highly protein-bound (>99%), metabolized in the liver into two metabolites. the drug is eliminated in the urine and feces.
b-indications:

it can be used alone or with metformin or insulin for better glycemic control.
c-dosage form:
tablets: 1mg, 2mg, 3mg, 4mg 
d-dosage and administration:
diet and exercise should be considered as primary form of treatment.
fasting glucose level or hba1 must be measured to determine minimum effective dose for the patient.
usual starting dose: 1-2mg od with breakfast or first main meal. maximum starting dose not more than 2 mg.
usual maintenance dose: 1-4mg od with maximum daily dose of 8mg. after reaching 2mg, increase the dose with increment of nmt 2mg at 1-2 week interval.
if glimepiride alone doesn’t provide adequate control, metformin can be added. doses can be adjusted to achieve desired blood glucose levels.
in patients not responding well to other treatments (secondary failure), it can be combined with insulin. typically, for fasting glucose >150mg/dl, 8mg of glimepiride is given once daily, and insulin doses are adjusted weekly.
in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, starting dose should be 1mg, if necessary titrated carefully in increment of 1mg at intervals of 1-2 weeks.

3-assignments
1-vitamin d supplements, recommended daily allowance, vitamin d analogues
vitamin d:
vitamin d (also referred to as calciferol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in a few foods, available as a dietary supplement and obtained from sun exposure. vitamin d obtained from all these sources is biologically inert and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. the first hydroxylation occurs in the liver, converting vitamin d to 25-hydroxyvitamin d [25(oh) d], also known as calcidiol. the second hydroxylation occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d [1, 25(oh) 2d], also known as calcitriol.
recommended daily allowance (rda):
0-12 months: 10mcg (400iu)
1-70 years: 15 mcg (600iu)
pregnancy/ lactation : 15mcg (600iu)
 vitamin d deficiency: 
the 25(oh) d level in the blood is the key indicator of vitamin d status. generally: 
20 ng/ml or higher: sufficient for most people
below 12 ng/ml: increased risk of deficiency
in children, vitamin d deficiency lead to rickets.
in adults/adolescents, vitamin d deficiency leads to osteomalacia.
